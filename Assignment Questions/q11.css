ul > li {
  display: inline;
}
/* why bullet-point remove? */
/*Reason:  <li> (list items) have their display property set to "list-item" 
by default, which makes them a bulleted list item. 
When this property is reset by you to "inline", 
the bullet points also disappear. 
In a way, we override the default settings with our CSS. */
